## Date: December 3, 2025

This document outlines all steps and commands executed to integrate the ACCESS CI organizational header and footer components into the Django CMS application.

## STEP 1: Research ACCESS CI UI Components
**Command:** github_repo search on access-ci-org/access-ci-ui
**Query:** "header footer navigation component HTML template"

**What it accomplished:**

- Identified key components: Header, Footer, Logo, Menu components
- Found CSS architecture and branding colors
- Located logo image paths: src/images/nsf-logo.png and src/images/access-logo.svg
- Discovered React-based components use Shadow DOM rendering
- Retrieved footer structure with NSF awards, social links, personas, and utility links

## STEP 2: Create Base Template
**File Created:** djangocmsjoy/templates/base.html

**What it accomplished:**
- Created comprehensive Django template that extends all CMS pages
